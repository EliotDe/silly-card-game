## Introduction

Simple card game using Java threading, and advanced OOP techniques.
Created using Java, tested using JUnit.

## Project Description

Unlimited number of players dealt a hand of 4 cards. Aim is to get 4 of the same card.
There is a discard pile to the left of each player, and a pickup pile to the right of the player.
Similar rules to GoFish, however players discard card to the bottom of the right deck, and pickup
from the top of the left deck. Players should not hold onto non-preferred denomination of cards
(i.e. Player2 should not hold onto 1's or 4's for example, and should prefer 2's).
